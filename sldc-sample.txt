1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
Activities:
Identify stakeholders: Users, SOS contacts, cab platforms, and developers.
Gather functional and non-functional requirements.
Feasibility study:
Technical feasibility: Evaluate the integration of APIs for cab platforms and SMS/email services.
Operational feasibility: Assess user adoption and ease of use.
Financial feasibility: Budget for development, deployment, and maintenance.
Deliverables:
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
Project roadmap and timelines.
2. System Design
Activities:
Design the system architecture:
Client-side: Ionic framework for cross-platform compatibility.
Backend: Node.js for API handling and MongoDB as the database.
UI/UX design:
Create wireframes for screens (e.g., Home, Contacts, and Settings).
Design interactive elements for ride tracking and SOS triggers.
Database design:
Define schemas for Users, Rides, and Alerts collections.
Third-party integration:
Plan API calls for cab platforms (e.g., Uber API).
Setup SMS/email services for notifications.
Deliverables:
System architecture diagram.
Wireframes and UI/UX mockups.
Database schema and ER diagrams.
3. Development
Activities:
Sprint 1:
Implement user authentication and SOS contact management.
Develop backend APIs for user management.
Sprint 2:
Integrate cab platform APIs for ride details and tracking.
Build real-time location tracking using Ionic Geolocation.
Sprint 3:
Implement the SOS alert system (manual and automated).
Develop notification mechanisms (SMS and email).
Sprint 4:
Finalize UI/UX with feedback from stakeholders.
Optimize for performance and cross-platform compatibility.
Deliverables:
Fully functional application modules for each sprint.
API endpoints for user management, ride tracking, and notifications.
4. Testing
Activities:
Unit Testing:
Test individual components (e.g., user authentication, SOS triggers).
Integration Testing:
Verify interactions between client-side and backend APIs.
System Testing:
Test the application in a production-like environment.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Gather feedback from a small group of beta testers.
Security Testing:
Ensure encryption for user data and secure API communication.
Deliverables:
Test case documents.
Bug reports and resolved issues.
UAT approval.
5. Deployment
Activities:
Prepare production environment:
Configure servers for Node.js and MongoDB.
Use cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability.
Publish the mobile app on platforms:
Android: Google Play Store.
iOS: Apple App Store.
Deliverables:
Deployed backend server and database.
Published mobile application.
6. Maintenance
Activities:
Monitor performance and resolve bugs.
Release updates for new features or platform changes (e.g., cab API updates).
Maintain scalability and security standards.
Deliverables:
Regular app updates.
Maintenance reports.
