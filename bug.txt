The warnings you're encountering are due to peer dependency conflicts between different packages in your project. These warnings are common when using modern versions of react and react-router-dom alongside older packages or dependencies that haven't been updated to support the latest versions.

Steps to Resolve These Warnings
1. Understand the Problem
The key conflicts in your logs are:

@ionic/react-router requires react-router-dom@^5.0.1, but you have react-router-dom@7.1.1 installed.
react-google-maps and recompose expect older versions of react and react-dom (^16.0.0), while your project uses react@18.x.
2. Upgrade Dependencies
Whenever possible, use updated versions of dependencies that are compatible with your react and react-router-dom versions.

Check if newer versions of the conflicting packages exist:
bash
Copy code
npm info @ionic/react-router
npm info react-google-maps
Upgrade the packages to their latest versions:
bash
Copy code
npm install @ionic/react-router@latest
npm install react-google-maps@latest
If the libraries are no longer maintained, consider switching to alternatives.

3. Downgrade React or React Router Versions (Optional)
If upgrading dependencies isn't an option, you may need to use versions of react and react-router-dom compatible with your dependencies. For example:

bash
Copy code
npm install react@16 react-dom@16 react-router-dom@5
4. Override Peer Dependencies
If you are sure the versions you have installed will work together (even if peer dependency warnings appear), you can force the installation by overriding the peer dependencies.

Add --legacy-peer-deps to your install command:
bash
Copy code
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
This tells npm to bypass peer dependency checks and install the versions you specified.
5. Use resolutions in package.json
If you want to force specific versions of dependencies, you can use the resolutions field (supported in Yarn or with the npm npm-force-resolutions package):

Add the following to your package.json:
json
Copy code
"resolutions": {
  "react-router-dom": "^5.3.4",
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
}
Run:
bash
Copy code
npx npm-force-resolutions
npm install
6. Switch to Alternative Libraries
For react-google-maps, consider switching to a maintained library like @react-google-maps/api, which supports modern React versions:

bash
Copy code
npm install @react-google-maps/api
Update your code to use this library instead.

7. Clean Node Modules and Reinstall
Sometimes, cleaning your environment can resolve dependency conflicts:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
Key Notes:
Upgrading dependencies is the best long-term solution.
Use --legacy-peer-deps only as a temporary measure to bypass dependency checks.
Switching to alternatives like @react-google-maps/api can future-proof your project.
After resolving the conflicts, test your application thoroughly to ensure compatibility.
